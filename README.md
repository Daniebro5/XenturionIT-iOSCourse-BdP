# iOS Development Course by Danni André Brito for XenturionIT

This repository holds an immersive, hands-on iOS development course presented by Danni André Brito on behalf of XenturionIT. Designed to give learners a robust foundation in iOS development, the course features comprehensive theoretical explanations accompanied by practical exercises. The course material includes a dedicated folder and project for each topic, allowing learners to work with real-world iOS development scenarios.

The unique feature of this course lies in its practical approach, with the inclusion of Unit Tests to reinforce learning and validate code implementation. Learners will find a separate folder containing the Unit Tests for each project. These tests provide instant feedback and allow learners to verify their code as they progress through the course.

## Course Content
The course covers a wide range of iOS development topics, including but not limited to:
- Introduction to iOS development
- Swift programming language fundamentals
- iOS user interface design and layout
- Working with data and APIs
- Core iOS frameworks and libraries
- App deployment and distribution on the App Store
- Design and architectural Patterns

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the project folders corresponding to each topic of the course.
3. Open the Xcode project file (.xcodeproj) for the desired topic in Xcode.
4. Review the project structure, source code, and accompanying documentation.
5. Execute the project and interact with the iOS app to understand its functionality.
6. Locate the Unit Tests folder within the project to access the relevant tests for that topic.
7. Open the Unit Tests and review the test cases to understand the expected behavior.
8. Run the Unit Tests to verify your implementation and ensure code correctness.
9. Repeat the process for each topic in the course, building upon the knowledge gained from previous projects.
